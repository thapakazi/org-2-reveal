** Defining the Title Slide
There is a special set of tags you can use to define the title slide and set the them and style of the  overall presentation.

At the top of the  my-presentation.org file, add Title, Author and Email tags to create the tile slide

Note: One thing I havent figured out yet is how to add a twitter handle, there does not seem to be an option for that.

** Available Themes

   default, beige, sky, night, serif, simple, moon

** Available Transitions

   default, cube, page, concave, zoom, linear, fade, none


** A very interesting slide

This slide is interesting because I am a geek :)

- bullet points can be added in moderation
- dont get too carried away with them


** Colored Slide
** This slide rolls in text line by line
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
     - show bullet-points
     - one by one

** Highlight the last bulletpoint in red
     - show all bullet-points straight away
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
     - then highlight the most important one

** This is a red Slide
     :PROPERTIES:
     :reveal_background: #FF0000
